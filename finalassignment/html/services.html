	<h4>Our Interworld Transition System</h4>
	<p>The Interworld Transition System (ITS) is a combination of external disks and internal connectors. The external disks are hooked to the spine, at the base of the skull. The internal connectors are micro needles inserted into the hippocampus, the neo-cortex, the cerebellum, and amygdala; the parts of the brain involved with the explicit human memory.</p>

	<h4>Medical Facility</h4>
	<p>Here, at EMPYREUS, we care about our clients’ wants. This is why we’ve built palliative care facilities (PVF) to make this transition stress-free. 

	To aid the emotional aspect of this procedure, clients have to be cleared by a psychiatrist to ensure acceptance of their nearing death—this is required for the ITS to work. Clients that are moved to the PVF are also required to complete fifty hours of therapeutic group session, led by our psychotherapists, concerning the changes happening in their lives. Patients who are physically disabled from their health circumstances and require constant medical attention cannot opt out; accommodations, such as individual therapy will be provided.</p>

	<h4>What We Cannot Do</h4>
	<p>Our procedures are extremely precise. When moved to a PVF, clients consent their choice to die of their current circumstance. This means that our medical professional will make no effort to resuscitate someone from a clinical death (breathing and blood flow ceases; the heart stops beating) and instead, we will attach the patient to an Interworld Transition System (ITS)—the machine will then migrate the patients to their chosen post-mortem existence.

	Clinical deaths are necessary for the ITS to work. After the heart ceases to beat, the brain may continue to function for ten minutes; in this state, the consciousness can easily be moved. In the case of a Complete Death (the brain has died), our professionals have only a few seconds.</p>

	<h4>Further Limitations</h4>
	<p>We cannot use our ITS on patients who have be declared clinically dead for more than an hour or succumbed a CD for more than one minute. Those numbers both represent the highest record held for transitioning a soul after passing. After those time stamps, we will no longer put time towards this patient’s transition. Money will always be refunded when a procedure is unsuccessful. 
	
	We also cannot do these procedures on highly damaged living bodies, as the panic within one’s mind during bodily trauma makes the soul too unstable to move.
	
	We do not transfer children’s souls because they cannot consent, and the End-of-Life forms cannot be completed by a parent or legal guardian. All must be 18 or older to go through this procedure. 

	This procedure only works ONCE. This means that if a body hosted by a soul that had chosen the afterlife in a previous form comes to use our ITS, their soul simply fade with the body and undergo a CD.</p>
