		<h3>SPECIAL OFFERS</h3>
	</div>

	<h4>Unique Circumstances</h4>
	<p>Due to the high costs of our facilities we, here at EMPYREUS, have special offers for special cases. Many medical files are sent our way and we give them all a good look. Our head office may contact anyone of the public waitlist with an offer to be moved into our facilities.	
	
	The following list outlines the points taken in consideration when going through the files: <i>infections and illnesses, age, current bodily health, family history, psychological health, ethnicity.</i></p>

	<p>Ethnicity is always put into consideration, as it is statistically proven that some humans may face harsher health repercussions due to socio-economic conditions and trauma build up in the body due to historical or generational trauma (i.e., slavery, war, natural disasters etc...).</p>

	<p><i>Some public hospitals are equiped with our ITS technology and may offer dying patients the choice to use our products. Proceedure, policies and techniques are performed by their own staff, and so, EMPYREUS will hold no responsibility for incidents or failed attempts performed outside our facilities.</i></p>
