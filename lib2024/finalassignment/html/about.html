	<h4>Who We Are & What We Do</h4>
	<p>TEMPYREUS is a medical and research facility owned by EMPYR Medical Corporation. We helps patients in need choose their soul’s path after death. Our stellar technology permits us to reach into the subconsciousness through corporeal human matter, post-bioticy, and direct the soul towards the hosts’ chosen path.</p>

	<p>Our patients may choose between the Afterlife, Rebirth or a Complete Death (CD).</p>

	<h4>Prophylactic Support System</h4>
	<p>Our neuroscientists have spent decades developing incredible techniques to preserve the soul once the body approaches death. This procedure is painless and takes less than two minutes.</p>

	<p>Through lengthy testing, our medical professionals are able to determine the precise week of a patients’ death, if not the day and hour. To avoid inducing our patients into a state of crisis, we keep this information private; there are few exceptions. With consent, patients will be given a general estimate (ex: a year, less than eight months etc...), unless the death day is fast approaching (in which case, they may be offered a consultation for death assisted by suicide).</p>
